This project embodies seamless DevOps integration, orchestrating a Node.js program's integration with GitHub. The process kicks off with GitHub triggering the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to conduct comprehensive build and testing operations using npm. Subsequently, the program undergoes packaging into a Docker container, seamlessly transferred to the Docker registry through automated procedures. This cohesive workflow showcases the complete lifecycle of DevOps projects, encapsulating integration, testing, packaging, and deployment with precision and efficiency.
